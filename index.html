            <p>Hi my name is Karl, i'm 27 years old and i love playing video games. I got into playing video games after watching my dad play mega man x on super nitendo and have been one playing them ever since.
                I also spend lots of my time with my lovey wife stephanie, we explore new places and have all kinds of fun. When not doing that i'm playing with my friends exploring new worlds though video games,
                or by playing dnd with them on saturdays. 
            </p>

            <p>I'm a hard worker, and love to constantly solve problems, especially ones that are tricky. Being on a computer is more home to me then anything else. Oh also i was born in raised majorly in Berwyn, Illinois
                where i lived a good majority of my life. I really like to fantisize about dragons, dinosaurs and wars and battles. I'm a very simple guy and do my best to work with others.
            </p>
